============

The project was conducted in the holidays of the summer semester 2014 at the University of Bamberg.
The tasks were taken partly from [ACM DEBS 2013](http://www.orgs.ttu.edu/debs2013/index.php?goto=cfchallengedetails) and must been solved with [Odysseus](http://www.uni-oldenburg.de/informatik/is/forschung/projekte/odysseus/). The match source file must be downloaded from the DEBS page and then the file path must be set as `DATAFILENAME` in the [source file](/src/TILB/source.qry).
